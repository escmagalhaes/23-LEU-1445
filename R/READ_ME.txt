Instructions
1. Run the R script from line 1 to 1137
2. Generate figures one at a time (line 1138 onwards)
3. Cytoscape might be a bit slow, so do not run the code all at once
4. Sections with the heading "PS protein groups analysis" are meant for exploratory data analysis (i.e. define protein lists for each PS). The output is very large, so it was left out of the main code script
